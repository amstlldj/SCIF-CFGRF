## 1.Copyright statement and update plan
###
This code repository is the official code repository of paper "Data Augmentation for Bearing Fault Diagnosis Using a Novel Flow-Based Generative Model", and the account author is the original author of the paper and source code. The project's file usage instructions will be supplemented later.
The code files of this repository are still being uploaded recently, and the weight files will be considered to be uploaded to Google Cloud Drive due to their large size. If you reference this project, please inform us in the issue, thank you!(2025-3-23)

## 2.Weight file download link
###
To ensure the credibility of our paper, we decided to provide the pre-trained weight files of our model, and also to facilitate readers to directly complete image data synthesis by loading our weight files into the generator file.
Our model pre-trained weight files can be obtained from this link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-nT8oyWBRETIntGGdyILk6AqfBFtFGXD?usp=drive_link
Replace the downloaded checkpoint folder with the downloaded checkpoint folder, and then load the corresponding .pth file in the folder in the generator to run and synthesize data.
