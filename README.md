Bearings are vital in industrial machinery, making fault diagnosis a crucial research area. However, the rarity of fault conditions leads to highly imbalanced signal data, biasing traditional methods toward normal states. To address this, we propose SCQ-CFGRF, a novel classifier-free guidance Rectified Flow generative model that integrates a specially designed Residual Seaformer, a novel Continuous Wavelet Transform-based feature extractor, and a creative Quality Enhancer. Unlike existing methods, SCQ-CFGRF transforms raw time-domain signals into richer time-frequency representations while leveraging Rectified Flow for superior sample quality and inference efficiency. Our approach first converts 1D time-domain data into 2D time-frequency heatmaps via a novel CFEN-block. Simultaneously, Rectified Flow is constructed to extract high-dimensional features. These are processed by a UNet backbone embedded with our RS-block to enhance feature representation. Category labels and time steps are fused to establish conditional dependencies, improving global spatiotemporal perception and enabling classifier-free guidance. Finally, our trained model employs a sampler with a QE-block to refine sample quality and perform synthesis via the Euler method of Rectified Flow. Experiments on two real-world bearing datasets and ablation studies demonstrate SCQ-CFGRFâ€™s superiority in synthesis quality and inference speed. Even under an extreme 1:400 class imbalance, it achieves 78.75\% to 81.15\% diagnostic accuracy, surpassing existing methods.

The key contributions of this study are as follows:

(1) We propose a new SCQ-CFGRF method framework, which introduces Rectified Flow into the field of fault diagnosis data synthesis for the first time and achieves fast, stable and high-quality synthesis of fault data samples. Meanwhile, two real-world experiments and ablation experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.

(2) In SCQ-CFGRF, in order to improve the signal feature extraction capability of the method framework, we specially designed a Continuous Wavelet Transform Feature Extraction Network block (CFEN-block). This block transforms the one-dimensional time domain signal into a two-dimensional time-frequency domain feature map through continuous wavelet transform and feature heat map formation, and then extracts various high-dimensional signal features through a deep learning network.

(3) In order to improve the quality and similarity of synthetic data, we embedded our newly designed Residual Seaformer block (RS-block) in the UNet backbone network of the method. According to the different levels in the network, they can be divided into RS1-block, RS2-block, and RS3-block. Through them, we can combine conditional and spatiotemporal information to improve the overall and detailed quality of synthetic data.

(4) We fuse conditional and time step information throughout the network to strengthen conditional dependencies and global spatiotemporal perception, enabling classifier-free guidance. Additionally, our newly designed Quality Enhancer block (QE-block) refines final samples using a Cosine Similarity-based enhancement mechanism, improving synthesis quality and efficiency.
